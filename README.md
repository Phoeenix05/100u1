# 100u1

100u1 or 100 under 1 is a repository that I use to combat my motivational issues.

I try to create something stupid, useless but somewhat working programs, scripts, etc under an hour of programming.

I don't know if I'm gonna make exactly 100 programs or if I will make more. The number 100 is there just because it
sounded nice.
